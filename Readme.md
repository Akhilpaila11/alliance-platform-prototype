The Alliance - Community Connection Prototype
Overview
"The Alliance" is a community platform designed to connect users based on their offerings and needs. The platform allows users to submit their skills and what they seek, and matches them with others who can provide relevant help or resources. The aim is to foster collaboration and meaningful connections in a community.

Key Features
User Intake Form: A simple form where users can submit their name, skills they offer, and needs they have.
Matching System: Based on the form submissions, users are matched with others who have complementary needs or offerings.
Leaderboard Display: A leaderboard showcasing the most active users and their connections.
Sample Conversation Generation: Upon successful matches, users are provided with conversation starters to help initiate collaboration.
Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (Python) for the server-side logic and handling form submissions.
Frontend: HTML and CSS for the user interface; JavaScript to fetch and display data dynamically.
Database: SQLite for temporary storage of user data (name, offerings, needs, and timestamps).
Deployment: Deployed on Heroku for online access.
